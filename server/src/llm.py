    Please refer to the below details of the properties in json format, based on the above mentioned features:
    Southwest Property: {sw_property_details}

    Competitor Property: {comp_property_details}
    Your task is to provide a detailed comparison between two property listings, one from Southwest and the other from {comp_property_firm}. The comparison should be formatted as a JSON array consisting of two objects. Each object represents a property listing and its distinctive features. 
    Within each object, you are expected to list the key differences that set each property apart from the other. These differences should be presented as items in an array associated with each property object. It's crucial that the descriptions for these points are thorough and elucidate the unique aspects of each property clearly and concisely. 
    For each feature difference, delve into specificsâ€”describe not just what the difference is, but also how it might impact the potential tenant's living experience or the property's appeal. Aim for parity in the number of points for each property to maintain a balanced comparison.
    Include as much information as you can about everything. Also if mentioning anything about distances use relative terms like near, far etc.
    For instance:
    {{
        "sw_property_details": [
            "Studio apartment with possibly no monthly rent mentioned.",
            "Includes basic appliances: Fridge and Stove.",
            "Utilities covered: Water, Heat, WiFi, and Laundry facilities.",
            "Lacks detailed parking information.",
            "Smaller unit size of 323 sqft not indicating furnished status."
        ],
        "{comp_property_firm}": [
            "1-bedroom loft style apartment with a monthly rent of $1600.",
            "Includes a wider range of appliances and possibly HVAC systems.",
            "Parking available at $95 per slot with 13 slots, suggesting better parking facilities.",
            "Lacks information on utilities covered by the rent.",
            "Unit size and furnished status not mentioned, implying potential for customization."
